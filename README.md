# Neural_Nets_And_Learning_Systems
This repository showcases lab work where we explored various topics using Python and a variety of libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow. The objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the following topics:

**Lab1 - A1_Supervised**: This lab covers K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Single-layer Neural Networks, and Multi-layer Neural Networks.

**Lab2 - A2_DeepLearning**: In this lab, we delve into Neural Networks using TensorFlow's Keras library.

**Lab3 - A3_Boosting**: The focus of this lab is on AdaBoost.

**Lab4 - A4_Reinforcenment**: This lab explores Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm.
